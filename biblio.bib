Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) of 20 sources between 220 MHz and 48.1 GHz, and legacy VLA observations at 73.8 MHz. The derived spectral flux densities are placed on an absolute scale by utilizing the Baars et al. values for Cygnus A (3C405) for frequencies below 2 GHz, and the Mars-based polynomials for 3C286, 3C295, and 3C196 from Perley & Butler above 2 GHz. Polynomial expressions are presented for all 20 sources, with accuracy limited by the primary standards to 3%–5% over the entire frequency range. Corrections to the scales proposed by Perley & Butler, and by Scaife & Heald are given.}

	abstract = "{A study is made of the implications of the recent polarization measurements for the structures of discrete radio sources and the source–observer media. Simple models of wavelength-dependent depolarizing mechanisms are investigated and it is found that most are incompatible with the observations of Gardner \\&amp; Whiteoak. The models of internal Faraday dispersion predict a lower polarization at 30 cm than is observed. It is suggested that the depolarization of the Crab nebula is produced by Faraday rotation in the filamentary shell that surrounds the nebula. Such filaments could also exist in the outer regions of extragalactic sources.A complex number representation is used for the state of linear polarization and a Faraday dispersion function is defined to describe the distribution of polarized radiation with respect to Faraday depth. The persistence of polarization at 30 cm, after partial depolarization between 10 cm and 20 cm, implies that the radiation is spread over a large range of Faraday depths. The observed linearity of the plot of the angle of polarization against wavelength squared for most sources implies that it is justifiable to make an assumption which enables one to calculate the Faraday dispersion function of a source from the dependence of its polarization on wavelength.Estimates are given for upper limits to the densities of internal ionized gases in the sources for which we have polarization measurements.}",

	abstract = {Abstract The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain–for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.

The method requires the recovery of the Faraday dispersion function from measurements restricted to limited wavelength ranges, which is an ill-conditioned deconvolution problem. Here, we discuss a recovery method that assumes a sparse approximation of the Faraday dispersion function in an overcomplete dictionary of functions. We discuss the general case when both thin and thick components are included in the model, and we present the implementation of a greedy deconvolution algorithm. We illustrate the method with several numerical simulations that emphasize the effect of the covered range and sampling resolution in the Faraday depth space, and the effect of noise on the observed data.}

We study intrinsic FDFs along sight lines through face-on Milky Way like galaxies by means of a sophisticated galactic model incorporating three-dimensional MHD turbulence, and investigate how much information the FDF intrinsically contains. Since the FDF reflects distributions of thermal and cosmic-ray electrons as well as magnetic fields, it has been expected that the FDF could be a new probe to examine internal structures of galaxies. We, however, find that an intrinsic FDF along a sight line through a galaxy is very complicated, depending significantly on actual configurations of turbulence. We perform 800 realizations of turbulence and find no universal shape of the FDF even if we fix the global parameters of the model. We calculate the probability distribution functions of the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of FDFs and compare them for models with different global parameters. Our models predict that the presence of vertical magnetic fields and the large-scale height of cosmic-ray electrons tend to make the standard deviation relatively large. In contrast, the differences in skewness and kurtosis are relatively less significant.}

This method is similar to the CLEAN algorithm for aperture synthesis of radio telescope images but it is rather unclear in what cases RM CLEAN works well. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of RM CLEAN by simulating spectro-polarimetric observations of two compact sources located in the same LOS, varying the relative initial polarization angle and Faraday depth systematically. In particular, we focus on whether the two polarized sources can be resolved in the Faraday depth space and how well the source parameters can be estimated. We confirm the previous studies that two sources cannot be resolved when they are closely located in the Faraday depth space for specific values of the relative initial polarization angle. Further, we calculate the chi-square value for the fit between the mock polarization spectrum data and the one from RM CLEAN. We find that the chi-square value is not always significantly large even when RM CLEAN gives wrong results.}",

We introduce a simple method for continuation of the observed complex polarized intensity P(λ2) into the domain λ2 \\&lt; 0 using symmetry arguments. The method is suggested in context of magnetic field recognition in galactic discs where the magnetic field is supposed to have a maximum in the equatorial plane. The method is quite simple when applied to a single Faraday rotating structure on the line of sight. Recognition of several structures on the same line of sight requires a more sophisticated technique. We also introduce a wavelet-based algorithm which allows us to consider a set of isolated structures in the (φ, λ2) plane (where φ is the Faraday depth).

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

	abstract={The spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN 1622, as measured by Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30 GHz and is suggestive of a Boltzmann cutoff in grain rotation frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission. LDN 1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the Cosmic Background Imager, which is the first centimeter-wave resolved image of a dark cloud. The 31 GHz emission follows the emission traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalized cross-correlation of the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6 σ for the 12 and 25 μm bands than for the 60 and 100 μm bands: C 12+25 = 0.76 ± 0.02, and C 60+100 = 0.64 ± 0.01. The mid-IR-centimeter-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36 GHz from a hot molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated regions (PDRs), the 12 and 25 μm emission is attributed to stochastic heating of the VSGs. The mid-IR and centimeter-wave dust emissions arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the PDR of LDN 1622, where the incident UV radiation from the Ori OB 1b association heats and charges the grains, as is required for spinning dust.}

	abstract={The finding of residual gas in the large central cavity of the HD 142527 disk motivates questions regarding the origin of its non-Keplerian kinematics and possible connections with planet formation. We aim to understand the physical structure that underlies the intra-cavity gaseous flows, guided by new molecular-line data in CO(6–5) with unprecedented angular resolutions. Given the warped structure inferred from the identification of scattered-light shadows cast on the outer disk, the kinematics are consistent, to first order, with axisymmetric accretion onto the inner disk occurring at all azimuths. A steady-state accretion profile, fixed at the stellar accretion rate, explains the depth of the cavity as traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and evidence for near free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical models for disk tearing, which could be driven by the reported low-mass companion, whose orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The companion’s high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive Kozai oscillations over long timescales; high-eccentricity periods may perhaps account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk could imprint an azimuthal modulation in the molecular-line maps, further observations are required to ascertain the significance of azimuthal structure in the density field inside the cavity of HD 142527.}

Using a communication-theory model for the process of image formation, we find that the most likely object has a maximum entropy and is represented by a restoring formula that is positive and not band limited. The derivation is an adaptation to optics of a formulation by Jaynes for unbiased estimates of positive probability functions. The restoring formula is tested, via computer simulation, upon noisy images of objects consisting of random impulses. These are found to be well restored, with resolution often exceeding the Rayleigh limit and with a complete absence of spurious detail. The proviso is that the noise in each image input must not exceed about 40\% of the signal image. The restoring method is applied to experimental data consisting of line spectra. Results are consistent with those of the computer simulations.}

	abstract = {{In many problems the primary data are the Fourier transform of the physical quantities which are of interest and the inverse Fourier transform is normally calculated with a digital computer. Disadvantages concerning this approach related to the presence of experimental errors in the data are pointed out and a description is presented of an alternative method of analysis based on the idea of maximum entropy. The concept is illustrated with the aid of data produced by the radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, UK. In this application the data are samples of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the radio brightness from the sky. The combination of maximum-entropy analysis with a proper treatment of experimental errors promises to be a powerful, yet safe, method for estimating the Fourier transform of incomplete and noisy data. The method is very easily generalized to deal with other types of data, not involving a Fourier transform.}},

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

It does not change by the use of a condensing lens, but depends only on the aperture of the illuminating cone. These properties are applied to the microscopic observation of objects in transmitted light."

	year={2015},
	abstract={A major goal of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is to make accurate images with resolutions of tens of milliarcseconds, which at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths requires baselines up to ∼15 km. To develop and test this capability, a Long Baseline Campaign (LBC) was carried out from 2014 September to late November, culminating in end-to-end observations, calibrations, and imaging of selected Science Verification (SV) targets. This paper presents an overview of the campaign and its main results, including an investigation of the short-term coherence properties and systematic phase errors over the long baselines at the ALMA site, a summary of the SV targets and observations, and recommendations for science observing strategies at long baselines. Deep ALMA images of the quasar 3C 138 at 97 and 241 GHz are also compared to VLA 43 GHz results, demonstrating an agreement at a level of a few percent. As a result of the extensive program of LBC testing, the highly successful SV imaging at long baselines achieved angular resolutions as fine as 19 mas at ∼350 GHz. Observing with ALMA on baselines of up to 15 km is now possible, and opens up new parameter space for submm astronomy.}

	journal={The Astrophysical Journal},
	volume={816},
	number={1},
	pages={25},
	year={2016},
	abstract={The recent ALMA observations of the disk surrounding HL Tau reveal a very complex dust spatial distribution. We present a radiative transfer model accounting for the observed gaps and bright rings as well as radial changes of the emissivity index. We find that the dust density is depleted by at least a factor of 10 in the main gaps compared to the surrounding rings. Ring masses range from 10–100 M ⊕ in dust, and we find that each of the deepest gaps is consistent with the removal of up to 40 M ⊕ of dust. If this material has accumulated into rocky bodies, these would be close to the point of runaway gas accretion. Our model indicates that the outermost ring is depleted in millimeter grains compared to the central rings. This suggests faster grain growth in the central regions and/or radial migration of the larger grains. The morphology of the gaps observed by ALMA—well separated and showing a high degree of contrast with the bright rings over all azimuths—indicates that the millimeter dust disk is geometrically thin (scale height ≈1 AU at 100 AU) and that a large amount of settling of large grains has already occurred. Assuming a standard dust settling model, we find that the observations are consistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of a few 10 −4 . We estimate the gas/dust ratio in this thin layer to be of the order of 5 if the initial ratio is 100. The HCO + and CO emission is consistent with gas in Keplerian motion around a 1.7 M ⊙ star at radii from ≤10–120 AU.}

	year={2015},
	abstract={A recent Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array image revealed several concentric gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star HL Tau. We consider the hypothesis that these gaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding the dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing estimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated constraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation of new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such systems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly shifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the exact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in the dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important barrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions following planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this degeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly interacting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce swift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of planetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive disks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets, we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune masses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass of Saturn. The inner two planets’ masses are unconstrained by dynamical stability arguments.}

It is similar to maximum-entropy techniques, but with an exact accounting of the multiplicity instead of the usual approximation involving Stirling's formula. It also incorporates an Occam factor, automatically limiting the effective amount of detail in the map to that justified by the data. We use Gibbs sampling to determine, to any desired degree of accuracy, the multidimensional posterior density distribution. From this we can construct a mean posterior map and other measures of the posterior density, including confidence limits on any well-defined function of the posterior map.}

In light of the recent theory of compressed sensing and in the perspective of defining the best possible imaging techniques for sparse signals, we analyse the related spread spectrum phenomenon and suggest its universality relative to the sparsity dictionary. Our results rely both on theoretical considerations related to the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries and on numerical simulations.}",

Convex optimization tasks under the compressive sensing framework have recently emerged and provide both enhanced image reconstruction quality and scalability to increasingly larger data sets. We focus herein mainly on scalability and propose two new convex optimization algorithmic structures able to solve the convex optimization tasks arising in radio-interferometric imaging. They rely on proximal splitting and forward-backward iterations and can be seen, by analogy, with the clean major-minor cycle, as running sophisticated clean-like iterations in parallel in multiple data, prior, and image spaces. Both methods support any convex regularization function, in particular, the well-studied ℓ1 priors promoting image sparsity in an adequate domain. Tailored for big-data, they employ parallel and distributed computations to achieve scalability, in terms of memory and computational requirements. One of them also exploits randomization, over data blocks at each iteration, offering further flexibility. We present simulation results showing the feasibility of the proposed methods as well as their advantages compared to state-of-the-art algorithmic solvers. Our matlab code is available online on GitHub.}",

However, to realize these goals significant challenges in image and data processing need to be overcome. The standard methods in radio interferometry for reconstructing images, such as clean, have served the community well over the last few decades and have survived largely because they are pragmatic. However, they produce reconstructed interferometric images that are limited in quality and scalability for big data. In this work, we apply and evaluate alternative interferometric reconstruction methods that make use of state-of-the-art sparse image reconstruction algorithms motivated by compressive sensing, which have been implemented in the purify software package. In particular, we implement and apply the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm presented in a recent article. First, we assess the impact of the interpolation kernel used to perform gridding and degridding on sparse image reconstruction. We find that the Kaiser-Bessel interpolation kernel performs as well as prolate spheroidal wave functions while providing a computational saving and an analytic form. Secondly, we apply purify to real interferometric observations from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array and find that images recovered by purify are of higher quality than those recovered by clean. Thirdly, we discuss how purify reconstructions exhibit additional advantages over those recovered by clean. The latest version of purify, with developments presented in this work, is made publicly available.}",

	abstract = "Compressed sensing (CS) is a revolutionary signal acquisition theory, enabling signal acquisition at a rate that is below the Nyquist sampling rate. However, CS signal reconstruction algorithms are computationally expensive. One of the key computation steps in CS algorithms is to iteratively compute a Cholesky decomposition. Modern application acceleration devices, such as FPGAs and GPUs, can accelerate Cholesky decomposition and CS signal reconstruction computation. This paper presents high performance parallel Cholesky decomposition algorithms for GPU and FPGA implementation. For GPUs, an optimized Cholesky decomposition algorithm is developed with high parallelism, reduced data copying, and improved memory access. For FPGAs, a dedicated pipelined hardware architecture for Cholesky decomposition is designed. Only one pipelined triangular linear equation solver is needed for solving Cholesky decomposition and Cholesky decomposition-based linear equation systems. Moreover, CS signal reconstruction algorithms are accelerated on GPUs and FPGAs for fast signal recovery based on our iterative Cholesky decomposition. Results show that the proposed Cholesky decomposition on FPGAs and GPUs are much faster than LAPACK and MAGMA for small matrices. For accelerating CS signal reconstruction algorithms, our FPGA implementation can achieve around 15× speedup and our GPU implementation can achieve about a 38× speedup compared with the CPU using LAPACK and the hybrid CPU/GPU system with MAGMA."

The GPU acceleration of the former bottleneck, namely the matrix--vector multiplications, transfers a significant portion of the computational burden to the identification of the support set. The software solves high-dimensional problems in fractions of a second which permits large-scale testing at dimensions currently unavailable in the literature.

	abstract="Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used in-vivo imaging technique that is essential to the diagnosis of disease, but its longer acquisition time hinders its wide adaptation in time-critical applications, such as emergency diagnosis. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) research have provided promising theoretical insights to accelerate the MRI acquisition process, but CS reconstruction also poses computational challenges that make MRI less practical. In this paper, we introduce a fast, scalable parallel CS-MRI reconstruction method that runs on graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster systems for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. We propose a modified Split-Bregman iteration using a variable splitting method for CS-based DCE-MRI. We also propose a parallel GPU Split-Bregman solver that scales well across multiple GPUs to handle large data size. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed method on several synthetic and real DCE-MRI datasets and compare with existing methods.",

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

	year={2006},
	abstract={The spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN 1622, as measured by Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30 GHz and is suggestive of a Boltzmann cutoff in grain rotation frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission. LDN 1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the Cosmic Background Imager, which is the first centimeter-wave resolved image of a dark cloud. The 31 GHz emission follows the emission traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalized cross-correlation of the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6 σ for the 12 and 25 μm bands than for the 60 and 100 μm bands: C 12+25 = 0.76 ± 0.02, and C 60+100 = 0.64 ± 0.01. The mid-IR-centimeter-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36 GHz from a hot molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated regions (PDRs), the 12 and 25 μm emission is attributed to stochastic heating of the VSGs. The mid-IR and centimeter-wave dust emissions arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the PDR of LDN 1622, where the incident UV radiation from the Ori OB 1b association heats and charges the grains, as is required for spinning dust.}

	abstract={The finding of residual gas in the large central cavity of the HD 142527 disk motivates questions regarding the origin of its non-Keplerian kinematics and possible connections with planet formation. We aim to understand the physical structure that underlies the intra-cavity gaseous flows, guided by new molecular-line data in CO(6–5) with unprecedented angular resolutions. Given the warped structure inferred from the identification of scattered-light shadows cast on the outer disk, the kinematics are consistent, to first order, with axisymmetric accretion onto the inner disk occurring at all azimuths. A steady-state accretion profile, fixed at the stellar accretion rate, explains the depth of the cavity as traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and evidence for near free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical models for disk tearing, which could be driven by the reported low-mass companion, whose orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The companion’s high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive Kozai oscillations over long timescales; high-eccentricity periods may perhaps account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk could imprint an azimuthal modulation in the molecular-line maps, further observations are required to ascertain the significance of azimuthal structure in the density field inside the cavity of HD 142527.}

Using a communication-theory model for the process of image formation, we find that the most likely object has a maximum entropy and is represented by a restoring formula that is positive and not band limited. The derivation is an adaptation to optics of a formulation by Jaynes for unbiased estimates of positive probability functions. The restoring formula is tested, via computer simulation, upon noisy images of objects consisting of random impulses. These are found to be well restored, with resolution often exceeding the Rayleigh limit and with a complete absence of spurious detail. The proviso is that the noise in each image input must not exceed about 40\% of the signal image. The restoring method is applied to experimental data consisting of line spectra. Results are consistent with those of the computer simulations.}

	abstract = {{In many problems the primary data are the Fourier transform of the physical quantities which are of interest and the inverse Fourier transform is normally calculated with a digital computer. Disadvantages concerning this approach related to the presence of experimental errors in the data are pointed out and a description is presented of an alternative method of analysis based on the idea of maximum entropy. The concept is illustrated with the aid of data produced by the radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, UK. In this application the data are samples of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the radio brightness from the sky. The combination of maximum-entropy analysis with a proper treatment of experimental errors promises to be a powerful, yet safe, method for estimating the Fourier transform of incomplete and noisy data. The method is very easily generalized to deal with other types of data, not involving a Fourier transform.}},

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

By a simple statistical method general formulae are found for deducing γ from illumination data. For any extended lightsource γ is found equal to the amplitude in a certain diffraction image. It does not change by the use of a condensing lens, but depends only on the aperture of the illuminating cone. These properties are applied to the microscopic observation of objects in transmitted light."

	abstract={A major goal of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is to make accurate images with resolutions of tens of milliarcseconds, which at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths requires baselines up to ∼15 km. To develop and test this capability, a Long Baseline Campaign (LBC) was carried out from 2014 September to late November, culminating in end-to-end observations, calibrations, and imaging of selected Science Verification (SV) targets. This paper presents an overview of the campaign and its main results, including an investigation of the short-term coherence properties and systematic phase errors over the long baselines at the ALMA site, a summary of the SV targets and observations, and recommendations for science observing strategies at long baselines. Deep ALMA images of the quasar 3C 138 at 97 and 241 GHz are also compared to VLA 43 GHz results, demonstrating an agreement at a level of a few percent. As a result of the extensive program of LBC testing, the highly successful SV imaging at long baselines achieved angular resolutions as fine as 19 mas at ∼350 GHz. Observing with ALMA on baselines of up to 15 km is now possible, and opens up new parameter space for submm astronomy.}

	journal={The Astrophysical Journal},
	volume={816},
	number={1},
	pages={25},
	year={2016},
	abstract={The recent ALMA observations of the disk surrounding HL Tau reveal a very complex dust spatial distribution. We present a radiative transfer model accounting for the observed gaps and bright rings as well as radial changes of the emissivity index. We find that the dust density is depleted by at least a factor of 10 in the main gaps compared to the surrounding rings. Ring masses range from 10–100 M ⊕ in dust, and we find that each of the deepest gaps is consistent with the removal of up to 40 M ⊕ of dust. If this material has accumulated into rocky bodies, these would be close to the point of runaway gas accretion. Our model indicates that the outermost ring is depleted in millimeter grains compared to the central rings. This suggests faster grain growth in the central regions and/or radial migration of the larger grains. The morphology of the gaps observed by ALMA—well separated and showing a high degree of contrast with the bright rings over all azimuths—indicates that the millimeter dust disk is geometrically thin (scale height ≈1 AU at 100 AU) and that a large amount of settling of large grains has already occurred. Assuming a standard dust settling model, we find that the observations are consistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of a few 10 −4 . We estimate the gas/dust ratio in this thin layer to be of the order of 5 if the initial ratio is 100. The HCO + and CO emission is consistent with gas in Keplerian motion around a 1.7 M ⊙ star at radii from ≤10–120 AU.}

	abstract={A recent Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array image revealed several concentric gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star HL Tau. We consider the hypothesis that these gaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding the dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing estimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated constraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation of new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such systems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly shifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the exact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in the dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important barrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions following planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this degeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly interacting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce swift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of planetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive disks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets, we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune masses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass of Saturn. The inner two planets’ masses are unconstrained by dynamical stability arguments.}

	abstract={We introduce a method for analyzing radio interferometry data that produces maps that are optimal in the Bayesian sense of maximum posterior probability density, given certain prior assumptions. It is similar to maximum-entropy techniques, but with an exact accounting of the multiplicity instead of the usual approximation involving Stirling's formula. It also incorporates an Occam factor, automatically limiting the effective amount of detail in the map to that justified by the data. We use Gibbs sampling to determine, to any desired degree of accuracy, the multidimensional posterior density distribution. From this we can construct a mean posterior map and other measures of the posterior density, including confidence limits on any well-defined function of the posterior map.}

	abstract = "Compressed sensing (CS) is a revolutionary signal acquisition theory, enabling signal acquisition at a rate that is below the Nyquist sampling rate. However, CS signal reconstruction algorithms are computationally expensive. One of the key computation steps in CS algorithms is to iteratively compute a Cholesky decomposition. Modern application acceleration devices, such as FPGAs and GPUs, can accelerate Cholesky decomposition and CS signal reconstruction computation. This paper presents high performance parallel Cholesky decomposition algorithms for GPU and FPGA implementation. For GPUs, an optimized Cholesky decomposition algorithm is developed with high parallelism, reduced data copying, and improved memory access. For FPGAs, a dedicated pipelined hardware architecture for Cholesky decomposition is designed. Only one pipelined triangular linear equation solver is needed for solving Cholesky decomposition and Cholesky decomposition-based linear equation systems. Moreover, CS signal reconstruction algorithms are accelerated on GPUs and FPGAs for fast signal recovery based on our iterative Cholesky decomposition. Results show that the proposed Cholesky decomposition on FPGAs and GPUs are much faster than LAPACK and MAGMA for small matrices. For accelerating CS signal reconstruction algorithms, our FPGA implementation can achieve around 15× speedup and our GPU implementation can achieve about a 38× speedup compared with the CPU using LAPACK and the hybrid CPU/GPU system with MAGMA."

This paper describes an implementation for graphics processing units (GPU) of hard thresholding, iterative hard thresholding, normalized iterative hard thresholding, hard thresholding pursuit, and a two-stage thresholding algorithm based on compressive sampling matching pursuit and subspace pursuit. The GPU acceleration of the former bottleneck, namely the matrix--vector multiplications, transfers a significant portion of the computational burden to the identification of the support set. The software solves high-dimensional problems in fractions of a second which permits large-scale testing at dimensions currently unavailable in the literature.

	abstract="Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used in-vivo imaging technique that is essential to the diagnosis of disease, but its longer acquisition time hinders its wide adaptation in time-critical applications, such as emergency diagnosis. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) research have provided promising theoretical insights to accelerate the MRI acquisition process, but CS reconstruction also poses computational challenges that make MRI less practical. In this paper, we introduce a fast, scalable parallel CS-MRI reconstruction method that runs on graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster systems for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. We propose a modified Split-Bregman iteration using a variable splitting method for CS-based DCE-MRI. We also propose a parallel GPU Split-Bregman solver that scales well across multiple GPUs to handle large data size. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed method on several synthetic and real DCE-MRI datasets and compare with existing methods.",

This paper studies the general theory of the AIC procedure and provides its analytical extensions in two ways without violating Akaike's main principles. These extensions make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize overparameterization more stringently to pick only the simplest of the ``true'' models. These selection criteria are called CAIC and CAICF. Asymptotic properties of AIC and its extensions are investigated, and empirical performances of these criteria are studied in choosing the correct degree of a polynomial model in two different Monte Carlo experiments under different conditions.",

The implementation of multi-scale CLEAN in the CASA software package is used, although comparisons are made against the very similar multi-resolution CLEAN algorithm implemented in AIPS. Both are compared against the classical CLEAN algorithm (as implemented in AIPS). The results of this comparison show that several of the well-known characteristics and issues of using classical CLEAN are significantly lessened (or eliminated completely) when using the multi-scale CLEAN algorithm. Importantly, multi-scale CLEAN significantly reduces the effects of the clean “bowl” that is caused by missing short-spacings, and the “pedestal” of low-level un-cleaned flux (which affects flux scales and resolution). Multi-scale CLEAN can clean down to the noise level without the divergence suffered by classical CLEAN. We discuss practical applications of the added contrast provided by multi-scale CLEAN using two selected astronomical examples: H I holes in the interstellar medium and anomalous gas structures outside the main galactic disk.}

The proposed technique reconstructs the image in each Stokes parameter from the corresponding full-complex Stokes visibilities by utilizing two regularization functions: the ℓ
1 norm and the total variation (TV) of the brightness distribution. As an application of this technique, we present simulated linear polarization observations of two physically motivated models of M87 with the Event Horizon Telescope. We confirm that ℓ
1+TV regularization can achieve an optimal resolution of ∼25%–30% of the diffraction limit , which is the nominal spatial resolution of a radio interferometer for both the total intensity (i.e., Stokes I) and linear polarizations (i.e., Stokes Q and U). This optimal resolution is better than that obtained from the widely used Cotton–Schwab CLEAN algorithm or from using ℓ
1 or TV regularizations alone. Furthermore, we find that ℓ
1+TV regularization can achieve much better image fidelity in linear polarization than other techniques over a wide range of spatial scales, not only in the superresolution regime, but also on scales larger than the diffraction limit. Our results clearly demonstrate that sparse reconstruction is a useful choice for high-fidelity full-polarimetric interferometric imaging.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Interferometric imaging now achieves angular resolutions as fine as ∼10 μas, probing scales that are inaccessible to single telescopes. Traditional synthesis imaging methods require calibrated visibilities; however, interferometric calibration is challenging, especially at high frequencies. Nevertheless, most studies present only a single image of their data after a process of “self-calibration,” an iterative procedure where the initial image and calibration assumptions can significantly influence the final image. We present a method for efficient interferometric imaging directly using only closure amplitudes and closure phases, which are immune to station-based calibration errors. Closure-only imaging provides results that are as noncommittal as possible and allows for reconstructing an image independently from separate amplitude and phase self-calibration. While closure-only imaging eliminates some image information (e.g., the total image flux density and the image centroid), this information can be recovered through a small number of additional constraints. We demonstrate that closure-only imaging can produce high-fidelity results, even for sparse arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope, and that the resulting images are independent of the level of systematic amplitude error. We apply closure imaging to VLBA and ALMA data and show that it is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of traditional self-calibration and CLEAN for these data sets.}

	abstract = {Results are presented of a new VLA-ROSAT study that probes the magnetic field strength and distribution over a sample of 16 "normal" low-redshift (z ≤ 0.1) galaxy clusters. The clusters span 2 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity and were selected to be free of (unusual) strong radio cluster halos and widespread cooling flows. Consistent with these criteria, most clusters show a relaxed X-ray morphology and little or no evidence of recent merger activity. Analysis of the rotation measure (RM) data shows cluster-generated Faraday RM excess out to ~0.5 h Mpc from cluster centers. The results, combined with RM imaging of cluster-embedded sources and ROSAT X-ray profiles, indicate that the hot intergalactic gas within these "normal" clusters is permeated with a high filling factor by magnetic fields at levels of icm = 5-10(ℓ/10 kpc)-1/2 h μG, where ℓ is the field correlation length. These results lead to a global estimate of the total magnetic energy in clusters and give new insight into the ultimate energy origin, which is likely gravitational. These results also shed some light on the cluster evolutionary conditions that existed at the onset of cooling flows.}

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware.

	abstract={The spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN 1622, as measured by Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30 GHz and is suggestive of a Boltzmann cutoff in grain rotation frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission. LDN 1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the Cosmic Background Imager, which is the first centimeter-wave resolved image of a dark cloud. The 31 GHz emission follows the emission traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalized cross-correlation of the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6 σ for the 12 and 25 μm bands than for the 60 and 100 μm bands: C 12+25 = 0.76 ± 0.02, and C 60+100 = 0.64 ± 0.01. The mid-IR-centimeter-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36 GHz from a hot molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated regions (PDRs), the 12 and 25 μm emission is attributed to stochastic heating of the VSGs. The mid-IR and centimeter-wave dust emissions arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the PDR of LDN 1622, where the incident UV radiation from the Ori OB 1b association heats and charges the grains, as is required for spinning dust.}

	abstract={The finding of residual gas in the large central cavity of the HD 142527 disk motivates questions regarding the origin of its non-Keplerian kinematics and possible connections with planet formation. We aim to understand the physical structure that underlies the intra-cavity gaseous flows, guided by new molecular-line data in CO(6–5) with unprecedented angular resolutions. Given the warped structure inferred from the identification of scattered-light shadows cast on the outer disk, the kinematics are consistent, to first order, with axisymmetric accretion onto the inner disk occurring at all azimuths. A steady-state accretion profile, fixed at the stellar accretion rate, explains the depth of the cavity as traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and evidence for near free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical models for disk tearing, which could be driven by the reported low-mass companion, whose orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The companion’s high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive Kozai oscillations over long timescales; high-eccentricity periods may perhaps account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk could imprint an azimuthal modulation in the molecular-line maps, further observations are required to ascertain the significance of azimuthal structure in the density field inside the cavity of HD 142527.}

Using a communication-theory model for the process of image formation, we find that the most likely object has a maximum entropy and is represented by a restoring formula that is positive and not band limited. The derivation is an adaptation to optics of a formulation by Jaynes for unbiased estimates of positive probability functions. The restoring formula is tested, via computer simulation, upon noisy images of objects consisting of random impulses. These are found to be well restored, with resolution often exceeding the Rayleigh limit and with a complete absence of spurious detail. The proviso is that the noise in each image input must not exceed about 40\% of the signal image. The restoring method is applied to experimental data consisting of line spectra. Results are consistent with those of the computer simulations.}

	abstract = {{In many problems the primary data are the Fourier transform of the physical quantities which are of interest and the inverse Fourier transform is normally calculated with a digital computer. Disadvantages concerning this approach related to the presence of experimental errors in the data are pointed out and a description is presented of an alternative method of analysis based on the idea of maximum entropy. The concept is illustrated with the aid of data produced by the radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, UK. In this application the data are samples of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the radio brightness from the sky. The combination of maximum-entropy analysis with a proper treatment of experimental errors promises to be a powerful, yet safe, method for estimating the Fourier transform of incomplete and noisy data. The method is very easily generalized to deal with other types of data, not involving a Fourier transform.}},

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

By a simple statistical method general formulae are found for deducing γ from illumination data. For any extended lightsource γ is found equal to the amplitude in a certain diffraction image. It does not change by the use of a condensing lens, but depends only on the aperture of the illuminating cone. These properties are applied to the microscopic observation of objects in transmitted light."

	abstract={A major goal of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is to make accurate images with resolutions of tens of milliarcseconds, which at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths requires baselines up to ∼15 km. To develop and test this capability, a Long Baseline Campaign (LBC) was carried out from 2014 September to late November, culminating in end-to-end observations, calibrations, and imaging of selected Science Verification (SV) targets. This paper presents an overview of the campaign and its main results, including an investigation of the short-term coherence properties and systematic phase errors over the long baselines at the ALMA site, a summary of the SV targets and observations, and recommendations for science observing strategies at long baselines. Deep ALMA images of the quasar 3C 138 at 97 and 241 GHz are also compared to VLA 43 GHz results, demonstrating an agreement at a level of a few percent. As a result of the extensive program of LBC testing, the highly successful SV imaging at long baselines achieved angular resolutions as fine as 19 mas at ∼350 GHz. Observing with ALMA on baselines of up to 15 km is now possible, and opens up new parameter space for submm astronomy.}

	abstract={The recent ALMA observations of the disk surrounding HL Tau reveal a very complex dust spatial distribution. We present a radiative transfer model accounting for the observed gaps and bright rings as well as radial changes of the emissivity index. We find that the dust density is depleted by at least a factor of 10 in the main gaps compared to the surrounding rings. Ring masses range from 10–100 M ⊕ in dust, and we find that each of the deepest gaps is consistent with the removal of up to 40 M ⊕ of dust. If this material has accumulated into rocky bodies, these would be close to the point of runaway gas accretion. Our model indicates that the outermost ring is depleted in millimeter grains compared to the central rings. This suggests faster grain growth in the central regions and/or radial migration of the larger grains. The morphology of the gaps observed by ALMA—well separated and showing a high degree of contrast with the bright rings over all azimuths—indicates that the millimeter dust disk is geometrically thin (scale height ≈1 AU at 100 AU) and that a large amount of settling of large grains has already occurred. Assuming a standard dust settling model, we find that the observations are consistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of a few 10 −4 . We estimate the gas/dust ratio in this thin layer to be of the order of 5 if the initial ratio is 100. The HCO + and CO emission is consistent with gas in Keplerian motion around a 1.7 M ⊙ star at radii from ≤10–120 AU.}

	abstract={A recent Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array image revealed several concentric gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star HL Tau. We consider the hypothesis that these gaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding the dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing estimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated constraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation of new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such systems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly shifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the exact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in the dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important barrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions following planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this degeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly interacting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce swift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of planetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive disks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets, we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune masses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass of Saturn. The inner two planets’ masses are unconstrained by dynamical stability arguments.}

It is similar to maximum-entropy techniques, but with an exact accounting of the multiplicity instead of the usual approximation involving Stirling's formula. It also incorporates an Occam factor, automatically limiting the effective amount of detail in the map to that justified by the data. We use Gibbs sampling to determine, to any desired degree of accuracy, the multidimensional posterior density distribution. From this we can construct a mean posterior map and other measures of the posterior density, including confidence limits on any well-defined function of the posterior map.}

However, CS signal reconstruction algorithms are computationally expensive. One of the key computation steps in CS algorithms is to iteratively compute a Cholesky decomposition. Modern application acceleration devices, such as FPGAs and GPUs, can accelerate Cholesky decomposition and CS signal reconstruction computation. This paper presents high performance parallel Cholesky decomposition algorithms for GPU and FPGA implementation. For GPUs, an optimized Cholesky decomposition algorithm is developed with high parallelism, reduced data copying, and improved memory access. For FPGAs, a dedicated pipelined hardware architecture for Cholesky decomposition is designed. Only one pipelined triangular linear equation solver is needed for solving Cholesky decomposition and Cholesky decomposition-based linear equation systems. Moreover, CS signal reconstruction algorithms are accelerated on GPUs and FPGAs for fast signal recovery based on our iterative Cholesky decomposition. Results show that the proposed Cholesky decomposition on FPGAs and GPUs are much faster than LAPACK and MAGMA for small matrices. For accelerating CS signal reconstruction algorithms, our FPGA implementation can achieve around 15× speedup and our GPU implementation can achieve about a 38× speedup compared with the CPU using LAPACK and the hybrid CPU/GPU system with MAGMA."

Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) research have provided promising theoretical insights to accelerate the MRI acquisition process, but CS reconstruction also poses computational challenges that make MRI less practical. In this paper, we introduce a fast, scalable parallel CS-MRI reconstruction method that runs on graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster systems for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. We propose a modified Split-Bregman iteration using a variable splitting method for CS-based DCE-MRI. We also propose a parallel GPU Split-Bregman solver that scales well across multiple GPUs to handle large data size. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed method on several synthetic and real DCE-MRI datasets and compare with existing methods.",

This paper studies the general theory of the AIC procedure and provides its analytical extensions in two ways without violating Akaike's main principles. These extensions make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize overparameterization more stringently to pick only the simplest of the ``true'' models. These selection criteria are called CAIC and CAICF. Asymptotic properties of AIC and its extensions are investigated, and empirical performances of these criteria are studied in choosing the correct degree of a polynomial model in two different Monte Carlo experiments under different conditions.",

abstract = {The regularized least squares for sparse reconstruction is gaining popularity as it has the ability to reconstruct speech signal from a noisy observation. The reconstruction relies on the sparsity of speech, which provides the demarcation from noise. However, there is no measure incorporated in the sparse reconstruction to optimize on the overall speech quality. This paper proposes a two-level optimization strategy to incorporate the quality design attributes in the sparse solution in compressive speech enhancement by hyper-parameterizing the tuning parameter. The first level involves the compression of the big data and the second level optimizes the tuning parameter by using different optimization criteria (such as Gini index, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)). The set of solutions can then be measured against the desired design attributes to achieve the best trade-off between suppression and distortion. Numerical results show the proposed approach can effectively fuse the trade-offs in the solutions for different noise profile in a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNR).}

  abstract={Sparsity of representations of signals has been shown to be a key concept of fundamental importance in fields such as blind source separation, compression, sampling and signal analysis. The aim of this paper is to compare several commonly-used sparsity measures based on intuitive attributes. Intuitively, a sparse representation is one in which a small number of coefficients contain a large proportion of the energy. In this paper, six properties are discussed: (Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates, and Babies), each of which a sparsity measure should have. The main contributions of this paper are the proofs and the associated summary table which classify commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions. Only two of these measures satisfy all six: the pq-mean with p les 1, q &gt; 1 and the Gini index.},

For multifrequency deconvolution, a technique named joined-channel cleaning is used. In this mode, the minor loop of our algorithm is two to three orders of magnitude faster than casa msmfs. We extend the multiscale mode with automated scale-dependent masking, which allows structures to be cleaned below the noise. We describe a new scale-bias function for use in multiscale cleaning. We test a second deconvolution method that is a variant of the moresane deconvolution technique, and uses a convex optimization technique with isotropic undecimated wavelets as dictionary. On simple well-calibrated data, the convex optimization algorithm produces visually more representative models. On complex or imperfect data, the convex optimization algorithm has stability issues.}",

ABSTRACT = {A Python non-uniform fast Fourier transform (PyNUFFT) package has been developed to accelerate multidimensional non-Cartesian image reconstruction on heterogeneous platforms. Since scientific computing with Python encompasses a mature and integrated environment, the time efficiency of the NUFFT algorithm has been a major obstacle to real-time non-Cartesian image reconstruction with Python. The current PyNUFFT software enables multi-dimensional NUFFT accelerated on a heterogeneous platform, which yields an efficient solution to many non-Cartesian imaging problems. The PyNUFFT also provides several solvers, including the conjugate gradient method, ℓ1 total variation regularized ordinary least square (L1TV-OLS), and ℓ1 total variation regularized least absolute deviation (L1TV-LAD). Metaprogramming libraries have been employed to accelerate PyNUFFT. The PyNUFFT package has been tested on multi-core central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs), with acceleration factors of 6.3–9.5× on a 32-thread CPU platform and 5.4–13× on a GPU.},

abstract = {The proximal map is the key step in gradient-type algorithms, which have become prevalent in large-scale high-dimensional problems. For simple functions this proximal map is available in closed-form while for more complicated functions it can become highly nontrivial. Motivated by the need of combining regularizers to simultaneously induce different types of structures, this paper initiates a systematic investigation of when the proximal map of a sum of functions decomposes into the composition of the proximal maps of the individual summands. We not only unify a few known results scattered in the literature but also discover several new decompositions obtained almost effortlessly from our theory.},

using Total Variation (TV) penalties. We study anisotropic (ℓ1-based) TV and also
a related ℓ2-norm variant. We consider for both variants associated (1D) proximity
operators, which lead to challenging optimization problems. We solve these problems
by developing Newton-type methods that outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.
More importantly, our ID-TV algorithms serve as building blocks for solving the harder
task of computing 2- (and higher)-dimensional TV proximity. We illustrate the computational
benefits of our methods by applying them to several applications: (i) image de-noising;
(ii) image deconvolution (by plugging in our TV solvers into publicly available software);
and (iii) four variants of fused-lasso. The results show large speedups—and to support
our claims, we provide software accompanying this paper.},

Multiple-dimensional extensions of the L-curve for selecting multiple regularization parameters are introduced, and a minimum distance function (MDF) is developed for approximating the regularization parameters corresponding to the generalized corner of the L-hypersurface. For the single-parameter (i.e. L-curve) case, it is shown through a model that the regularization parameters minimizing the MDF essentially maximize the curvature of the L-curve. Furthermore, for both the single-and multiple-parameter cases the MDF approach leads to a simple fixed-point iterative algorithm for computing regularization parameters. Examples indicate that the algorithm converges rapidly thereby making the problem of computing parameters according to the generalized corner of the L-hypersurface computationally tractable.}

Multiple-dimensional extensions of the L-curve for selecting multiple regularization parameters are introduced, and a minimum distance function (MDF) is developed for approximating the regularization parameters corresponding to the generalized corner of the L-hypersurface. For the single-parameter (i.e. L-curve) case, it is shown through a model that the regularization parameters minimizing the MDF essentially maximize the curvature of the L-curve. Furthermore, for both the single-and multiple-parameter cases the MDF approach leads to a simple fixed-point iterative algorithm for computing regularization parameters. Examples indicate that the algorithm converges rapidly thereby making the problem of computing parameters according to the generalized corner of the L-hypersurface computationally tractable.}

	abstract = {Using one-dimensional models, we show that a helical magnetic field with an appropriate sign of helicity can compensate the Faraday depolarization resulting from the superposition of Faraday-rotated polarization planes from a spatially extended source. For radio emission from a helical magnetic field, the polarization as a function of the square of the wavelength becomes asymmetric with respect to zero. Mathematically speaking, the resulting emission occurs then either at observable or at unobservable (imaginary) wavelengths. We demonstrate that rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows for the reconstruction of the underlying Faraday dispersion function in the former case, but not in the latter. The presence of positive magnetic helicity can thus be detected by observing positive RM in highly polarized regions in the sky and negative RM in weakly polarized regions. Conversely, negative magnetic helicity can be detected by observing negative RM in highly polarized regions and positive RM in weakly polarized regions. The simultaneous presence of two magnetic constituents with opposite signs of helicity is shown to possess signatures that can be quantified through polarization peaks at specific wavelengths and the gradient of the phase of the Faraday dispersion function. Similar polarization peaks can tentatively also be identified for the bi-helical magnetic fields that are generated self-consistently by a dynamo from helically forced turbulence, even though the magnetic energy spectrum is then continuous. Finally, we discuss the possibility of detecting magnetic fields with helical and non-helical properties in external galaxies using the Square Kilometre Array.}

The images used for this study were obtained from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey which was carried out at five frequencies, viz. 88, 118, 154, 188 and 215 MHz. We detect diffuse radio emission in eight of these clusters. We have estimated the spectra of haloes and relics in these clusters over the frequency range 80–1400 MHz; the first such attempt to estimate their spectra at low frequencies. The spectra follow a power law with a mean value of α = −1.13 ± 0.21 for haloes and α = −1.2 ± 0.19 for relics, where S ∝ να. We reclassify two of the cluster sources as radio galaxies. The low-frequency spectra are thus an independent means of confirming the nature of cluster sources. Five of the nine clusters host radio haloes. For the remaining four clusters, we place upper limits on the radio powers of possible haloes in them. These upper limits are a factor of 2–20 below those expected from the LX–P1.4 relation. These limits are the lowest ever obtained and the implications of these limits to the hadronic model of halo emission are discussed.}",

abstract={We introduce a generalization of the linearized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to optimize a real-valued function f of multiple arguments with potentially multiple constraints {\$}{\$}g{\_}{\backslash}circ{\$}{\$}on each of them. The function f may be nonconvex as long as it is convex in every argument, while the constraints {\$}{\$}g{\_}{\backslash}circ{\$}{\$}need to be convex but not smooth. If f is smooth, the proposed Block-Simultaneous Direction Method of Multipliers (bSDMM) can be interpreted as a proximal analog to inexact coordinate descent methods under constraints. Unlike alternative approaches for joint solvers of multiple-constraint problems, we do not require linear operators {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}L{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}of a constraint function {\$}{\$}g({\{}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}L{\}}{\}}{\}}{\backslash} {\backslash}cdot ){\$}{\$}to be invertible or linked between each other. bSDMM is well-suited for a range of optimization problems, in particular for data analysis, where f is the likelihood function of a model and {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}L{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}could be a transformation matrix describing e.g. finite differences or basis transforms. We apply bSDMM to the Non-negative Matrix Factorization task of a hyperspectral unmixing problem and demonstrate convergence and effectiveness of multiple constraints on both matrix factors. The algorithms are implemented in python and released as an open-source package.},

	abstract = {We present the confusion-limited 1.28 GHz MeerKAT DEEP2 image covering one primary-beam area with θ = 7.″6 FWHM resolution and rms noise. Its J2000 center position α = 04h 13m 26.ˢ4, δ = −80° 00′ 00″ was selected to minimize artifacts caused by bright sources. We introduce the new 64-element MeerKAT array and describe commissioning observations to measure the primary-beam attenuation pattern, estimate telescope pointing errors, and pinpoint (u, v) coordinate errors caused by offsets in frequency or time. We constructed a 1.4 GHz differential source count by combining a power-law count fit to the DEEP2 confusion P(D) distribution from 0.25 to 10 μJy with counts of individual DEEP2 sources between 10 μJy and 2.5 mJy. Most sources fainter than S ∼ 100 μJy are distant star-forming galaxies (SFGs) obeying the far-IR/radio correlation, and sources stronger than 0.25 μJy account for ∼93\% of the radio background produced by SFGs. For the first time, the DEEP2 source count has reached the depth needed to reveal the majority of the star formation history of the universe. A pure luminosity evolution of the 1.4 GHz local luminosity function consistent with the Madau & Dickinson model for the evolution of SFGs based on UV and infrared data underpredicts our 1.4 GHz source count in the range .}

We also process a close-packed mosaic of 14 additional pointings in COSMOS and use these in conjunction with the Early Science pointing to investigate methods for primary beam correction of broad-band radio images, an analysis that is of relevance to all full-band MeerKAT continuum observations, and wide-field interferometric imaging in general.
